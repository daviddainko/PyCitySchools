    "According to the data currently available, it seems that the schools that performed the best were primarily charter, smaller, and spent fewer dollars per student; There is a gradual increase in the rate of students passing both math and reading when looking across downwards spending ranges, school sizes, and simply between types. \n",
    "\n",
    "District schools appear to have more students in all cases and, concurrently, higher spending amounts, which then ostensibly yield fewer returns, in terms of passing rates. \n",

    "These results could be due to the quality of the schooling students receive and the socio-economic status of the areas that the schools are located in. Data relating to the number of teachers per student as well as the average income of both the students' families as well as the average citizen of the locale in question could be used in further analysis the disparities between charter and district schools."
